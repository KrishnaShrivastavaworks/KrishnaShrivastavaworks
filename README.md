## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a software-focused engineering student who enjoys turning ideas into working systems using **C++ and Python**, while actively exploring **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

I learn best by building — experimenting with projects, breaking things, fixing them, and growing stronger with every iteration. I’m especially interested in **software development, intelligent systems, and data-driven technologies**, and I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate and improve.
